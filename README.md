an github favorites application - desktop version only


The aim of Challenge 06 in the Rocketseat Explorer program was to create a GitHub favorites page. The page allows users to add or remove favorite profiles and displays information such as the number of repositories and followers for each profile.

At the start of the application, the user sees an empty list of profiles and a message indicating that there are no favorites yet.

If the user tries to add a profile that does not exist, an alert message will appear informing them that the user was not found. If the user attempts to add a profile that has already been added to their favorites, an alert message will let them know that the user is already registered. In case the user decides to remove one of their favorite profiles, they will be asked to confirm whether they really want to delete the selected user.
